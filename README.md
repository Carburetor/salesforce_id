Gem to properly convert from and to 15 characters case sensitive format and
18 characters case insensitive format for salesforce record ID.

It's implemented as a C library to make the conversion as fast and performant
as possible.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'salesforce_id'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install salesforce_id

## Usage

The gem can be used as easily as:

```ruby
id15 = "003G000001SUbc4"
id18 = "003G000001SUbc4IAD"

# Convert to insensitive id, 18 characters
SalesforceId.to_insensitive(id15) == id18 # => true

# Convert to sensitive id, 15 characters
SalesforceId.to_sensitive(id18) == id15 # => true

# Check if salesforce id is valid
SalesforceId.valid?(id15)  # => true
SalesforceId.valid?(id18)  # => true
SalesforceId.valid?("foo") # => false

# Fixes casing for case-insensitive ids
SalesforceId.repair_casing(id18.downcase) == id18 # => true

# Check if id is case-sensitive format
SalesforceId.sensitive?(id15) # => true
SalesforceId.sensitive?(id18) # => false
SalesforceId.sensitive?(nil)  # => false

# Check if id is case-insensitive format
SalesforceId.insensitive?(id18) # => true
SalesforceId.insensitive?(id15) # => false
SalesforceId.insensitive?(nil)  # => false
```
